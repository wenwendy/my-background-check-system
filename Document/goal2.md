### Goal
- A GET end point to retrieve invitation status
- Persist invitation status in an RDB (e.g. use Postgres docker image)
- Define POST payload

- 
### Assumptions:
- One background check provider only at any time.
- Ignore provider implementation.
- POST request to API is low in load and will be communicated and actioned successfully.
